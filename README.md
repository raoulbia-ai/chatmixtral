ChatMixtral
=====================

Welcome to the ChatMixtral repository! This repo contains the codebase for the ChatMixtral application, an application designed to deliver a seamless chat experience with the Mixtral LLM. Leveraging the power of React, I've created a minimialistic UI that facilitates real-time messaging. The backend consists of a Python Flask application.


Getting Started
---------------

**Prerequisites:**
Before diving in, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

Running the Application
-----------------------

To start the development server, execute `npm start`. This compiles the application and launches it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Building for Production
-----------------------

For production builds, run [`npm run build`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fraoulbia%2Frepos%2Fwp-chatmixtral%2Ffrontend%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/README.md"). This command prepares optimized assets in the [`build`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fraoulbia%2Frepos%2Fwp-chatmixtral%2Ffrontend%2FREADME.md%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "frontend/README.md") directory, ready for deployment.

Testing
-------

For local testing, initiate the application with `npm start`. To ensure a clean state, clear the browser's local and session storage by executing `localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload();` in the browser console.

Deployment
----------

For detailed instructions on deploying the application to various platforms, refer to the [Create React App deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
